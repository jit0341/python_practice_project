âœ… SQL â€“ Day 2 Summary: Filtering + Sorting

ðŸ”¹ 1. Logical Operators

âž¤ AND â€“ All conditions must be true

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND CustomerName LIKE 'B%';
![Query: Country = Germany](screenshots/country_germany.png)

âž¤ OR â€“ At least one condition must be true

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Mexico';

âž¤ NOT â€“ Negates the condition

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE NOT Country = 'Germany';

(Also same as Country <> 'Germany')


---

ðŸ”¹ 2. Sorting with ORDER BY

âž¤ Sort in ascending order (default)

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName;

âž¤ Sort in descending order

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
ORDER BY CustomerName DESC;

âž¤ Sort by multiple columns

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;


---

ðŸ”¹ 3. Limiting Results (W3Schools / Access Syntax)

âž¤ Show top 5 rows:

SELECT TOP 5 * 
FROM Customers;

âž¤ Top 5 sorted by country:

SELECT TOP 5 * 
FROM Customers
ORDER BY Country ASC;

ðŸ§  Note:

Use TOP in W3Schools (Microsoft Access)

Use LIMIT in MySQL / SQLite:

SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 5;
