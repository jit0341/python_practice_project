## Getting Started

To run any script from this repository, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jit0341/python_practice_project.git](https://github.com/jit0341/python_practice_project.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd python_practice_project
    ```

3.  **Run any Python script:**
    Replace `filename.py` with the name of the script you want to execute (e.g., `python area_of_rectangle.py`).
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```
