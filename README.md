# Python Practice Project

**Python License: MIT**

This repository is a collection of Python practice programs created during my learning and exploration of Python programming. It includes basic scripts that demonstrate fundamental concepts and small applications.

---

## Getting Started

To run any script from this repository, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jit0341/python_practice_project.git](https://github.com/jit0341/python_practice_project.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd python_practice_project
    ```

3.  **Run any Python script:**
    Replace `filename.py` with the name of the script you want to execute (e.g., `python area_of_rectangle.py`).
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```

## Prerequisites

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## âœ… To Do

* Add user input validation to all interactive scripts
* Include comments in all scripts for better readability
* Refactor repeated code using functions
* Add a script that uses lists and loops together
* Explore file handling and save outputs
* Add more screenshots for each program
* Link scripts directly from the README

## Future Enhancements

(This section is for your notes/ideas - you can expand on these or remove if not needed in the final README)

* Consider adding visual badges (e.g., Python version, license) for appeal.
* Automate deployment or testing setup.
