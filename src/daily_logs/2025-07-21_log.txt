[06:54] Added JSON files to python and executed.
[06:56] products.json: The source JSON data file.
[06:56] * create_products_json.py: A helper script to ensure the products.json file is correctly created and populated.
[06:56] * json_processor.py: Your main script that demonstrates:
[06:56] * Changing JSON to Dictionary (json.load() from products.json into products_data).
[06:56] * Processing the Python products_data (calculating average, identifying out-of-stock items).
[06:56] * Changing Dictionary to JSON (implicitly done by json.dump()).
[06:56] * Saving as JSON File (creating out_of_stock_products.json).r all

[07:19] ----------------------------------------------
[07:19] [06:54] Added JSON files to Python project and executed successfully.
[07:19] [06:56] products.json: Created and verified source JSON data.
[07:19] [06:56] create_products_json.py: Wrote helper script to create/populate products.json.
[07:19] [06:56] json_processor.py: Main script demonstrating:
[07:19] - Reading JSON to Dictionary (json.load)
[07:19] - Processing data (average, out-of-stock items)
[07:19] - Converting Dictionary back to JSON (json.dump)
[07:19] [06:57] Saved processed data into out_of_stock_products.json
[07:19] üí° Takeaway:
[07:19] - JSON is not a language, but a structured data format.
[07:19] - No need for separate JSON study ‚Äî learn via use in real projects.
[07:19] - CSV is next, but can be learned later as needed.
[07:20] ‚úÖ Routine maintained. Ready for next step.exit
