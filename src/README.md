# Python Practice – Core Source

This `src/` directory is the primary and most updated
source of Python learning and practice in this repository.

It contains:
- Fundamentals (basics, loops, functions, data structures)
- Utilities and reusable modules
- Mini projects
- Automation scripts
- Experiments and advanced topics

Older numbered folders at the repository root
represent earlier learning phases and are kept
for reference and history.
