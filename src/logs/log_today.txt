📝 Today’s Log:
----------------------------------------------
[06:54] Added JSON files to Python project and executed successfully.
[06:56] products.json: Created and verified source JSON data.
[06:56] create_products_json.py: Wrote helper script to create/populate products.json.
[06:56] json_processor.py: Main script demonstrating:
       - Reading JSON to Dictionary (json.load)
       - Processing data (average, out-of-stock items)
       - Converting Dictionary back to JSON (json.dump)
[06:57] Saved processed data into out_of_stock_products.json

💡 Takeaway:
- JSON is not a language, but a structured data format.
- No need for separate JSON study — learn via use in real projects.
- CSV is next, but can be learned later as needed.

✅ Routine maintained. Ready for next step.
