## About The Project

This project serves as a personal learning log and a resource hub, demonstrating fundamental and intermediate Python concepts through practical examples. It covers:

* **Basic Syntax & Operations**: Variables, data types, arithmetic.
* **Control Flow**: If/else statements, loops.
* **Data Structures**: Lists, with a focus on various operations.
* **Functions**: Defining and using functions.
* **User Input & Interaction**: Handling input and creating interactive scripts.
* **Mini-Projects**: Small, self-contained applications like quizzes and games.

The goal is to provide clear, runnable examples that illustrate how different Python features can be applied to solve common problems and build simple applications.

## Sample Output Screenshots

You can find visual examples of some program outputs in the `screenshots/` directory.

![Sample Output](screenshots/sample_output_placeholder.png) ---

## To Do

Here's what's next on the roadmap for this project:

* ‚úÖ Add user input **validation** to relevant scripts.
* ‚úÖ Ensure **comments** are added to all scripts for better understanding.
* ‚úÖ **Refactor repeated code** using functions to promote reusability.
* ‚úÖ Add new scripts demonstrating the combined use of **loops and lists**.
* ‚úÖ Explore **file handling** concepts and implement saving program outputs.
* ‚úÖ Add **more screenshots** of program outputs to the `screenshots/` folder.
* ‚úÖ Add **clickable links** directly to individual scripts from this README. (This will be a bit more work, but very useful!)

---

## Future Enhancements

Exciting ideas for future development:

* Integrate more **visual badges** (e.g., Python version, test status).
* Automate **testing setup** for all scripts using a framework like `pytest`.
* Expand existing games with more complex logic or a simple **graphical user interface (GUI)**.
* Develop a **command-line interface (CLI)** for some utility scripts.
