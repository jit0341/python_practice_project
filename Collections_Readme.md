# Python Collections (Arrays)

# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# 1. List:
#    - Ordered
#    - Changeable (Mutable)
#    - Allows duplicate members

# 2. Tuple:
#    - Ordered
#    - Unchangeable (Immutable)
#    - Allows duplicate members

# 3. Set:
#    - Unordered
#    - Unchangeable* (Items cannot be changed, but you can add/remove)
#    - Unindexed
#    - Does NOT allow duplicates

# 4. Dictionary:
#    - Ordered (since Python 3.7)
#    - Changeable
#    - Indexed by keys
#    - Does NOT allow duplicate keys
